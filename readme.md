# Reptilian_Procedural_Generated_Animation_using_Raylib

Welcome to the **Procedural Generated Animation** project! This program uses C++ and the raylib library to animate a reptilian creature, like a snake or a fish, by simulating the vertebrate structure of such animals to create a fluid animation.

## Features

- **Procedural Animation**: Generates fluid animations for reptilian creatures using procedural generation techniques.
- **Realistic Movement**: Mimics the movement logic of vertebrates to create lifelike animations.
- **Customizable**: Easily tweak parameters to change the behavior and appearance of the animated creature.
- **Real-time Simulation**: All animations are generated and displayed in real-time.

## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- C++ compiler
- [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) library
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (or any preferred IDE)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/vb8146649/Reptilian_Procedural_Generated_Animation_using_Raylib.git
    cd Reptilian_Procedural_Generated_Animation_using_Raylib
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    - Follow the instructions on the [raylib website](https://www.raylib.com/) to install raylib.
    - Ensure your C++ compiler is set up correctly.

3. Build the project:
    - Open the project in your IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code).
    - Build the project using the build tools provided by your IDE.

## Usage

Run the executable generated after building the project. You will see a window with the animated reptilian creature.

- Use the controls to interact with the animation.
- Adjust parameters in the code to change the behavior and appearance of the creature.

## Customization

You can customize the animation by modifying the parameters in the code. For example, you can change the number of segments, the speed of the movement, and other properties to achieve different animation effects.
